## Assignment 10: "I Screwed Up, Now What?" Recovery 🚑

### Task Summary:
- Created a branch named `experiment`.
- Added three commits to `todo.txt`: `"Try this"`, `"Nope"`, and `"Maybe"`.
- Rebased `experiment` onto `main` for a cleaner history.
- Then decided to reset back to the first commit (`Try this`).
- Force pushed the reset branch to GitHub.
